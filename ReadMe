# Codebase for Neuro 240 Final Project - Hari Narayanan

File descriptions:

1.) SplitGenerator.ipynb contains code that divides the dataset of 3500 songs into chunks of 
ten seconds and labels each chunk by the name of the ragam of the song from which the chunk was cut.

2.) spectrogramgenerator.ipynb converts each chunk into a mel spectrogram and stores the mel spectrogram
in a pickle file with a corresponding ragam label, grouped into pickle files by ragam name.

3.) RagamModel.ipynb contains the code for the various iterations of the CNN considered for this task.
Contains data loading, model architecture, training, validation, and testing code, as well as associated
visualizations for each of these stages.
